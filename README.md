Quick guide to structure your microservices project

## What is a Microservice Architecture?
Microservice architecture is a form of service-oriented architecture (SOA) whereby software applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled services, as opposed to one monolithic software application.  Each microservice can be created independently from the other, or even in a completely different programming language and run on their own.

Modularising software this way makes the source code easier to understand and follow, developers can visualize the codebase and know roughly where to look for defects â€“ thereby making maintenance more efficient. Software systems built using microservices architecture are also easier to scale as the number of users increase.
